# Heart-Disease-prediction using ML Techniques

1) A study shows that from 1990 to 2016 the death rate due to heart diseases have increased around 34 per cent from 155.7 to 209.1 deaths per one lakh population in India.

2) Thus preventing Heart diseases has become quite necessary. smart data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases will improve the complete analysis and hindrance method, ensuring that a lot of folks will live healthy lives. this can be wherever Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the guts diseases, and also the predictions created square measure quite correct.
